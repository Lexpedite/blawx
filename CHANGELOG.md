# Changelog

Notable changes to Blawx will be documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
As of v0.2-alpha, this project is attempting to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
While alpha, however, any version may include breaking changes that may not be specifically noted as such,
and breaking changes will not necessarily result in changes to the main version number.

## [v1.3.16-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.16-alpha) 2022-06-23

### Added
* Beard Tax Act example project

### Fixed
* Code runs properly when single quotes occur in the text fields of a category or attribute customize block


## [v1.3.15-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.15-alpha) 2022-06-22

This release improves the interview endpoint's method of determining which attributes and categories
are relevant, and also improves BlawxBot's ability to describe fact scenarios and derive relevant
categories from relevant attributes. The Wills Act example has been modified to demonstrate
these capabilities, and the documentation updated.

### Changed
* The interview endpoint was modified to calculate question relevance better, and BlawxBot was
  revised to match.
* The Wills Act example and documentation was updated to demonstrate the new reasoning capabilities.

### Removed
* An example project was temporarily removed.

## [v1.3.14-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.14-alpha) 2022-06-22

Removing temporary fix for problems with SWI-Prolog. If you experience problems using
this version, you may need to rebuild the docker container using the `--no-cache` option,
to ensure that Docker grabs the latest release of SWI-Prolog when building.

### Changed
* The MQI.pl file and the steps in the Dockerfile for installing it have been removed,
  as the problems with MQI have now been resolved in the latest version of SWI-Prolog.

## [v1.3.13-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.13-alpha) 2022-06-21

This update brings all of the documentation included up to speed with the current version
of the software, taking into account outstanding bugs.  

### Added
* Documentation for Answers and Explanations
* Documentation for Dates and Durations
* Documentation for Defaults and Exceptions
* Documentation for Logical Constraints
* Documentation for Numerical Constraints
* Documentation for Numbers and Math
* Documentation for BlawxBot
* Documentation for Web API
* Documentation for CLEAN
* Several Example Documentation Pages
* Linked new blocks to their own help pages

### Changed
* Completely re-organized and re-wrote the Beginner's Guide to Blawx
* Updated all other documentation to current version.
* User interface documentation now uses animated gifs

## [v1.3.12-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.12-alpha) 2022-06-17

### Fixed
* Legal texts with sandwich sections caused the code editor to crash. ([Issue #258](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/issues/258))

## [v1.3.11-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.11-alpha) 2022-06-08

Milestone: Automated Interviews

This release marks the end of the automated interview milestone. Expect near-future changes
to focus on updating documentation, adding demonstrations, and occasional bug fixes.

### Changed
* The interview end point now generates relevant category and attribute data on the basis of
  an abductive query based on the user's input so far.
* BlawxBot now uses the relevance information from the interview end point to determine whether
  or not it needs to ask each question.
* The Rock Paper Scissors demonstrate code has been modified to ensure that games and players
  are relevant categories in BlawxBot. This may be undone once
  BlawxBot is dealing better with category relevance and question order.

### Added
* A Wills Act demonstration, with a test that can be run in BlawxBot to demonstrate that it
  is deciding whether to ask questions on the basis of whether they are logically relevant.

## [v1.3.10-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.10-alpha) 2022-06-07

Fixing display of attributed variables in answers.

### Changed
* Inequality and numerical constraints on bound variables are now displayed in the bindings of answers.
* Names generated by the reasoner are not displayed as attributes.

## [v1.3.9-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.9-alpha) 2022-06-03

Added ontology and interview endpoints for tests, and added BlawxBot demonstration expert systems to tests.

Note that there are a lot of improvements to come in BlawxBot, but it will at least run all the existing example tests.

Also made the navigation tree and output pane display automatically, to simplify the interface for new users.

### Added
* Each test now has a `onto/` endpoint from which a list of categories, attributes, and their natural language
  generation expressions can be obtained.
* Each test now has a `interview/` endpoint which will currently return any answers that can be
  generated, ignoring the "known" entries in the data submitted over JSON, and a list of relevant
  categories and attributes to collect as input. Currently, all categories and attributes are returned
  in all cases.
* Demonstration chatbot at `bot/` for each test
* "Bot" button in test endpoint.

### Fixed
* The ontology endpoint now works with codebases that have no attributes in them.

### Changed
* The Copyright notice in the footer was corrected.
* The output pane in tests is displayed automatically when the user clicks "Run".
* The navigation pane in the code interface is displayed automatically when the page opens.


## [v1.3.8-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.8-alpha) 2022-05-12

Updates to the JSON data format expected by the tests/run endpoint.

### Added
* You can now make "assume" statements in your data payload to
  the test/run endpoint.

### Changed
* The format expected by the test/run endpoint now looks like this:
  ```
  {
    "person": {
      "members_known": false,
      "attributes_known": {
        "test_attribute": false
      },
      "members": {
        "jason": {
          "favourite_number": {
            "values_known": false,
            "values": [42]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  Detailed documentation will come later, but the 'members_known', 'attributes_known', and 'values_known',
  give you the ability to add three different sorts of
  "assume" statements over the JSON Payload.


## [v1.3.7-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.7-alpha) 2022-05-11

Dates and Durations.

### Added
* Date and Duration Data Type Selectors
* Date and Duration Value Inputs
* Date and Duration Builders, Comparison, Date Add, Date Difference
* Net 30 Example

## [v1.3.6-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.6-alpha) 2022-05-11

This release just finishes a first draft of the code for the Rule 34 example, and adds
a test that replicates the experiment originally done in [Morris, Jason. "Constraint answer set programming as a tool to improve legislative drafting: a rules as code experiment." *Proceedings of the Eighteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law*. 2021.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3462757.3466084)

### Changed
* Rule 34 example is finished

### Added
* Test for Rule 34 example

## [v1.3.5-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.5-alpha) 2022-05-09

This release adds some examples, but more importantly makes some changes to the reasoner to
ensure that a problem with some tests not returning results.
The Rule 34 example is incomplete, and will be updated in a later release.

Much thanks to Jan Wielemaker (SWI-Prolog) and Eric Zinda (MQI) for upstream code changes
that were necessary to get those tests running.

### Added
* Some examples rules, and tests.

### Changed
* Some tests will now return an additional variable named "Attributes".

### Fixed
* Problems with some queries that appeared not to terminate have been corrected.
* links to rules in a span of text now show up properly in explanations

## [v1.3.4-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.4-alpha) 2022-04-27

This update makes changes to the back-end of how code is generated by Blawx. The
only user-facing change should be the fix below.

### Fixed
* Code with comments in the Blocks will now work properly (issue #184)

## [v1.3.3-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.3-alpha) 2022-04-20

This update improves the formatting of explanations in the reasoner, adds text
of the relevant rules to the output of the reasoner, and makes corresponding
changes to the API endpoint for running tests.

This version will break code that was using the previous version of the blocks
in the "known sections" drawer of the toolbox.

### Added
* Answers include the bindings of the variables named in the Question.
* A new `{rulenumber}/rule/{section_id}` endpoint has been created that will return
  the XML and plain text of a portion of the rule's text document indicated by the `eId`
  attribute for the AkomaNtoso section.

### Changed
* If a question returns multiple explanations, they are now grouped according
  to the bindings for the variables in the question. This allows the user to
  see which explanations are for the same answer.
* Explanations are now presented in a nested collapsible tree structure, so
  that the user can navigate to the portions of the explanation that are
  most relevant for them.
* The format of results from the `{rulenumber}/{testname}/run` endpoint has
  been modified extensively.
* In explanations, when a rule is mentioned in an "according to",
  the name of the rule is a link with a tooltip that
  will show the text of the relevant section.
* We have changed how rule names are displayed in explanations to avoid
  exposing implementation details not relevant to the user.

## [v1.3.2-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.2-alpha) 2022-04-07

This update allows you to use the defeasibility features for defaults
and exceptions that occur inside a single section of the rules.

### Added
* Blawx now supports the use of span elements generated in Clean>=0.0.4
* In the Rule navigator, now only clicking on the "arrow" will open
  up the sub-parts of a section of a rule.

## [v1.3.1-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.1-alpha) 2022-03-29

### Fixed
* Problems with primary and known section drawers in Test interface.

## [v1.3.0-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.0-alpha) 2022-03-28

This update adds defeasibility back to the v1 series.

### Added
* There is now an "Exceptions" drawer in the toolbox, with the blocks required
  for using the defeasibility system: overrules, opposes, according to, and holds.
* There is now a "Known Sections" drawer, with rule section selectors for each
  of the elements in the rule navigation tree, for use in the according to and
  overrules blocks.
* A new example has been added called Tweety that shows how the exceptions
  system works.

### Changed
* The primary drawer is now dynamically generated, and has two additional
  entries, a query that includes the "holds" block, and a rule that includes
  the "according to" block filled in for the currently-selected rule.

## [v1.2.0-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.2.0-alpha) 2022-03-11

The point of this update is to make it easy to edit your natural-language
legislation inside the Blawx interface. The minor version change indicates
that fixtures in the previous versions will no longer load in this version of
blawx because the data structure has changed.

### Added
* Rule Editing View

### Changed
* Laws are now specified using the [clean markdown language](https://github.com/lexpedite/clean), instead of in Akoma Ntoso. Akoma Ntoso is still used to generate the user interface, and the ability to export and import Akoma Ntoso
  will be added later.

### Removed
* The demonstration Rule demonstrating a complicated Akoma Ntoso example has
  been removed.

## [v1.1.0-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.1.0-alpha) 2022-03-01

### Added
* Code is now organized among Rules, Sections, and Tests
* Rules can be created using Akoma Ntoso encodings of legislation
* Complex Akoma Ntoso example
* Simple Rock Paper Scissors example with encoding and test

### Changed
There have been significant changes to almost all aspects of the tool, many of
which are breaking. You can expect that code created with any previous version
will not work in this version.

## [v1.0.6-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.0.6-alpha) 2022-02-08

### Added
* JSON Input primary block
* Documentation page for JSON input primary block
* JSON input processing on run endpoint

### Changed
* Requests to run code from the interface now use application/json content type

### Added
* Natural language explanations
* Multiple model responses to queries
* Numerical constraints
* Logical constraints
* Compiler warnings
* Live code generation
* Server side management of workspaces
* User Authentication
* Example workspaces (not modifiable by anonymous users)
* Assumptions, hypothetical reasoning

### Changed
* Code generation has been moved to the client side
* The entire block language has been updated
* The web API uses code stored on the server
