# Changelog

Notable changes to Blawx will be documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
As of v0.2-alpha, this project is attempting to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
While alpha, however, any version may include breaking changes that may not be specifically noted as such,
and breaking changes will not necessarily result in changes to the main version number.

## [v1.6.22-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.22-alpha) 2023-10-18

### Fixes
* Fresh installs were failing due to dependency issues.

## [v1.6.21-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.21-alpha) 2023-09-21

### Fixes
* Attributed rules subject to applicability with multiple category checks were slowing the code.

## [v1.6.20-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.20-alpha) 2023-09-21

This release is backwards compatible with v1.6.19-alpha.

### Fixes
* Applies Blocks cause slow-downs in code speed.

## [v1.6.19-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.19-alpha) 2023-07-27

This release includes bug-fixes.

**NB**: This release incorporates a change to the Blockly API that was implemented in Blockly 10.
In order to ensure that this release works properly, when building the image you may need to use the
`--no-cache` flag on the `docker build` command to ensure docker uses the latest version of the Blockly library.
See INSTALL.md for details. If you are having difficulties, inside the rule editor run `Blockly.VERSION` in the browser console.
The version should be 10.0.0 or later.

### Fixes
* Crash in scenario editor on ontology endpoint for certain code
* Errors setting value in dropdown (caused by changes to Blockly)
* Issue [#563](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/issues/563), files owned by Admin were not working properly
* Issue [#562](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/issues/562), reasoner incorrectly formats section references

## [v1.6.18-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.18-alpha) 2023-07-20

This release resolves three bugs in the scenario editor.

### Fixed
* Issue [#543](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/issues/543)
* Issue [#449](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/issues/449)
* Issue [#561](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/issues/561)


## [v1.6.17-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.17-alpha) 2023-07-18

This release adds validation for category names, attribute names, object names, relationship names, and variable names.
The corresponding blocks will now convert invalid names to valid names where possible, and will reject names that they
cannot convert.

This version is reverse compatible with .blawx files from previous versions. However, invalid names will be either corrected
if possible, or if not possible to correct will be replaced with the default value for the relevant field. This may have unexpected
effects in encodings with invalid field values.

### Changed
* New Relationship, New Category, New Attribute, New Object, and Variable blocks now validate and correct
  names as follows:
  * first letters will be corrected to uppercase for variables and lowercase for all others
  * spaces at the start and end will be removed
  * spaces elsewhere will be converted to underscores
  * names with symbols other than letters, numerals, underscore, and space will be rejected
  * names that end in an underscore followed by numerals will be rejected
* Documentation has been updated to reflect the new behaviour.



## [v1.6.16-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.16-alpha) 2023-06-26

`.blawx` files created in previous versions will work with this version, but **please note that the majority of URLs are now different**.

### Added
* Projects now have a path slug based on their name, which must be unique per user. The slug can be changed in the admin interface.

### Changed
* All URLS that previously began with `/{rule_id}/` now start with `/{owner}/{rule_slug}/`
  For example `/1/test/who_won` would now be `/jason/rock-paper-scissors-act/test/who_won`.
  This is intended to give some predictability to the location of the API endpoints for a loaded `.blawx` file to simplify development using
  Blawx as a legal reasoner.

## [v1.6.15-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.15-alpha) 2023-05-23

### Added
* If you provide an API access key for an OpenAI account, Blawx will use ChatGPT-3.5 to summarize its explanations and display those summaries in scenario editor.

### Changed
* Disclaimer has been added to the GCWeb styled version of the scenario editor.

## [v1.6.14-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.14-alpha) 2023-05-12

### Added
* A GCWeb-themed version of Scenario Editor

### Fixed
* Event reasoning was finding spurious evidence of non-interruption.


## [v1.6.13-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.13-alpha) 2023-05-09

### Fixes
* Favicon works properly
* JSON errors no longer occur in test editor
* Blockly warnings no longer occur in test editor and code editor

## [v1.6.12-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.12-alpha) 2023-05-09

This release chances how code is generated for projects. To upgrade existing files you may need to
open each section of the code and re-save it.

### Fixes
* Numerical constraints with equality work properly
* Date constraints no longer fail on type errors related to the beginning and end of time
* Scenario editor now displays all relevant constraints in the explanations
* Scenario editor will now display reasoner errors if they occur.
* The OASA example is no longer published by default.
* Scenario Editor and Test Editor no longer crash when dealing with attributed rules in the root section of the project.
* Disequalities and numerical constraints now appear in explanations.

## [v1.6.11-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.11-alpha) 2023-05-08

### Fixes
* Files saved in v1.6.10-alpha would lose information for parameters 4+ on load.

## [v1.6.10-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.10-alpha) 2023-05-05

This release fixes project imports, and makes the current version almost reverse compatible with v1.6.0-alpha forward.

**To update existing .blawx files from v1.6.0-alpha forward, you need to load the file, 
find all the relationship declaration blocks,
and reset the type values for each parameter, and save each section of code.**

### Fixes
* Upgrades examples.
* Examples and previously saved files would not load.
* Project Import did not work in code editor and test editor.

## [v1.6.9-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.9-alpha) 2023-05-05

This release resolves a problem with dynamic dropdown menus in three blocks that would sometimes forget their values
without letting the user know.

**NB**: If you rename or delete a category that has been selected in a dropdown, that dropdown will be reset to the first still-available
option. In relationships, this will be "number", in attribute declaration type, "true / false", and everwhere else it
will be the first listed category.

### Fixes
* Improves speed of the coding interface by reducing how frequently categories are updated.
* Makes Category and DataType dropdowns remember their values, and update properly when available categories change.

## [v1.6.8-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.8-alpha) 2023-05-04

### Fixes
* Problem where relationships were not formatted properly in scenario editor explanations.

## [v1.6.7-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.7-alpha) 2023-05-04

### Fixes
* Date, time, and duration values sent from Scenario Editor were not being received properly by the reasoner

## [v1.6.6-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.6-alpha) 2023-05-04

### Fixes
* Published Projects not appearing in login and logout screens.
* Test "Save as..." disabled for users without permission
* Scenario Editor save default facts/view are disabledfor users without permission

## [v1.6.5-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.5-alpha) 2023-05-03

### Fixes
* Problem experienced when running negated queries over a date add block.

## [v1.6.4-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.4-alpha) 2023-05-03

### Fixes
* Problem with importing .blawx files
* Problem with the display of durations that are returned from the reasoner as terms

## [v1.6.3-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.3-alpha) 2023-05-03

### Fixes
* Fixes crash on new project screen

## [v1.6.2-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.2-alpha) 2023-05-02

This version makes significant changes to the visual appearance of Blawx.

### Added
* A collapsible navigation bar on the left side of the screen for all pages, including documentation.

### Changed
* The overall look and feel has been changed and standardized.
* The right-bar in code editor and test editor has been replaced with a tabs interface.
* The navigation tab has been moved to the top in code editor as part of the breadcrumb.

## [v1.6.1-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.1-alpha) 2023-04-27

This release adds to the representational power of Blawx by adding "relationships", which are
a statement that is true (or not) about 3 or more objects or values.

### Added
* Relationship Declaration Block
* Relationship Selector Blocks
* Known Relationship Drawer
* Associated documentation

### Changed
* `/onto` endpoint returns information about relationships in addition to categories and attributes
* the JSON format accepted by the `test` and `interview` endpoints now accepts relationships in addition to categories and attributes
* The response from the ontology endpoint is now shown in the "devel" tab of the scenario editor.
* Scenario Editor has been modified to support relationships.
* Rock Paper Scissors example was updated to use relationships for throws instead of attributes.
* Associated documentation

### Fixed
* Problems with natural language generation for non-boolean attributes in test editor explanations

## [v1.6.0-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.6.0-alpha) 2023-04-11

**This release is NOT backward compatible.**

This release adds event reasoning features to the Blawx language. In addition to saying what is true,
you can now indicate when it was true, and when it ceased to be true. It also re-implements date math
using s(CASP)'s numerical constraints, which makes event reasoning possible, increases the speed of date calculations,
and allows comparison constraints over dates.

### Upgrade Notes
Upgrading code for v1.5.4-alpha to v1.6.0-alpha will require:

* Replacing all existing duration blocks, converting years and months into days as required.
* Re-saving workspaces using any of the modified blocks (e.g. date, time, datetime value, date add, duration and date comparison blocks)
* Replacing date add days, date diff, and date diff days blocks with the new date add block
* Eliminating the use of date, time, datetime, and duration constructors
* Replacing math calculation blocks with numerical constraints set to "equal"

Blocks that have been removed from the drawers will still display, in v1.6.0-alpha, so that they can be replaced. But they will not
function as intended, and are deprecated, and may be removed from any future version of Blawx.

### Added
* Event Drawer
* Initially, Ultimately, From, As of, and During blocks
* New Life Act example demonstrating use of event blocks
* Date, datetime, and duration from timestamp blocks
* Associated documentation on event reasoning and new event and date blocks

### Changed
* Duration value blocks no longer have Year and Month fields
* The date add block can now be used for addition or subtraction by leaving one of the three fields unbound
* Date and duration comparisons and calculations are now implemented as numerical constraints
* When date constraints are displayed in the scenario editor, Blawx tries to determine the data type and formats the constraint appropriately
* Updated documentation for changed blocks, features
* The numerical constraint block was reformatted, and has equality and disequality operators added to it
* All of the feature and block documentation has been brought up to date
* The way that dates, times, datetimes, and durations are displayed in the test editor explanations has been improved to make them more readable
* Examples have been updated to use the new block language

### Removed
* Date Add Days, Date Diff, and Date Diff Days blocks
* Date, Duration, and Time Constructor blocks
* Calculation block
* Documentation for removed blocks

## [v1.5.3-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.5.3-alpha) 2023-03-16

### Fixed
* Logical Constraints now work as expected
* Numerical Constraints now work as expected
* Numerical and disunity constraints on variables appear in explanations
* Question blocks can now accept more than one statement block.
* Interview Reasoner endpoint would crash when provided with numerical values specified in code.
* Constraints appear in Test Editor Explanations

### Changed
* Updated documentation for constraints and questions

### Added
* Logical Constraints example & documentation
* Numerical Constraints example & documentation

## [v1.5.2-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.5.2-alpha) 2023-03-15

This release front-loads the process of generating Akoma Ntoso and Code Editor navigation trees
to immediately after the rule text is saved, for a dramatic improvement in speed whenever legal text is displayed, including when you open the code editor, and when answers are displayed.

### Changed
* Load time for the code editor is dramatically improved
* Answers are displayed more quickly in test editor and scenario editor
* Saving rule text, importing projects, and opening example projects is slightly slower
* Additional project fields have been added to the admin interface


## [v1.5.1-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.5.1-alpha) 2023-03-13

### Changes
* The default in v1.5.0-alpha that sections are applicable to object by default is removed.
  Default applicability should be specified by presumption, as indicated in the defaults, exceptions, and applicability
  section of the documentation.
* Documentation and examples have been updated to reflect that change.

### Fixes
* The "login" link on the registration screen now has a working target. (Thanks @ASmith26 !)
* Spelling error in attributed rule block

## [v1.5.0-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.5.0-alpha) 2023-03-10

**This release is NOT backward compatible.**

This release revises the way defaults and exceptions are dealt with, dramatically speeds up code using defaults and exceptions,
simplifies getting access to legislative text in explanations without using defaults and exceptions,
and makes it possible to specify objects to which a rule does not "apply." All examples have been updated to the new
block language, the Bird Act example has been modified to show the new features,
and the relevant documentation has been updated.

### Upgrade Notes

To bring code from pre v1.5.0-alpha up to date, you will primarily need to update overrules blocks, update "holds" blocks,
replace "according to" blocks with "holds" blocks where appropriate (only where you are concerned about the source of
the conclusion), and switch to attributed rules where the conclusions are
subject to exceptions. Most questions which previously used the "holds" block can now have the holds block left out, and will
work properly. Note that conclusions in attributed rule blocks also no longer need to be wrapped in "according to" blocks in
order to be defeasible. Checking the "subject to exceptions" checkbox has that same effect.

### Changes
* Overrules Block
* Holds Block
* Updated examples to new block language
* New version of Bird Act example demonstrating enhanced features
* Updates to documentation for changed blocks, changed examples, and defaults, exceptions, and applicability

### Adds
* Attributed Rule Block
* Defeated Block
* Applies Block
* New Documentation
* In addition to being contradicted, rules can now also be made inapplicable to certain objects.

### Removes
* Opposes Block
* Documentation for opposes block

### Fixes
* Defeating rules will not longer defeat if they are themselves defeated
* Rules can be defeated by multiple other rules
* Links to legislative material can be obtained without checking for defeating rules
* Rules can be disabled in addition to contradicted
* Error in OASA example that made people eligible by default
* New categories not available in the code editor
* Reasoner endpoints were returning duplicate explanations

## [v1.4.1-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.4.1-alpha) 2023-03-02

This release fixes two bugs in how explanations were being displayed in the scenario editor.

### Fixes

* Some paragraphs in explanations were being repeated.
* Paragraphs for logically false conclusions were not being displayed correctly.

## [v1.4.0-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.4.0-alpha) 2023-02-28

**This release is NOT backward compatible.**

This release makes a number of interface changes, and 
significantly changes the way that Blawx deals with true / false values. Instead of
being treated as a statement about an object and a value (true, or false),
they are treated as a statement about an object alone. This has considerable
implications for the block language, and as a result, `.blawx` files exported prior to v1.4.0-alpha
will not work from v1.4.0-alpha forward.

True / False attributes are created using the new attribute declaration block. Specifying that a true or false attribute
has the value of "false" is done by using the "known false" block, and the new style of true / false
attribute selector block, in a fact or conclusion. Stating that it has the value "true" is done by 
merely using the new attribute selector block.

This change makes the block language considerably smaller, as it replaces 4 blocks, and removes another 
14.

Significant changes have also been made to the fact interface in scenario editor, allowing for a
number of important new features. Whereas previously, it was possible to specify known positive facts,
and uncertainty about objects or attributes of objects, it is now possible to specify known true,
known false, and uncertain facts, and it is possible to do that with both specific and general
parameters.

The interface has been simplified to a list of facts in natural language that can be deleted if they
were provided by the user, and a single button that allows the user to make new statements.

### Upgrade Process

The process for upgrading Blawx code to this version is as follows:
* Phase 1: Replace declarations in all sections and tests
  * replace all category declarations with a new category declaration with the same name and NLG (typically, "object is a X")
  * replace all attribute declarations with a new attribute declaration with the same name and NLG
* Phase 2: Replace Usage in all sections and tests
  * replace all boolean attribute selectors with the new style of boolean attribute selector
  * replace all object category blocks with the new style of object category block.
  * replace new object declarations for categories where you changed the NLG
  * replace attribute selectors for non-boolean attributes where you changed the NLG
  * replace category equivalence blocks with rules that use the new object category blocks in both the conditions and conclusion
* Phase 3: Delete Orphaned Blocks
  * find and delete orphaned true and false value blocks (explained below)

Doing declarations across all code sections and tests first avoids the need to come back to any section of code more than twice.

Because of changes in the type checking in attribute blocks, old-style boolean attribute blocks will reject
the "True" or "False" value blocks, and orphan (disconnect) them. When that happens, they may not be visible in the workspace until the code has
been saved and reloaded from save twice. All code being migrated should be opened at least
twice, and any floating "True" or "False" blocks appearing in the top left of the workspace the second time it is opened should be deleted.

There are circumstances in which adding more than one of the new style of attribute declaration block might cause
that block not to update properly when the attribute type is set to "true / false". If this happens, add all the required attribute declarations,
save and re-open the workspace, and the attribute declarations will then format themselves properly. This problem only occurs when migrating.

**NB**: It will not be possible to migrate from pre-v1.4 code to post-v1.4 code indefinitely. At some point, old block types will be removed from the language, making upgrades more difficult or impossible. If you have code that you want to keep using, upgrade it now, or you may have to rewrite it from scratch in a future version.

### Added
* The Wills Act Tutorial example page in the documentation now links to a YouTube video demonstrating
  the use of Blawx, and it is linked from the front page.

### Changed
* Toolboxes are reorganized
* New Category Declaration Block
* New Attribute Declaration Block
* New Object Category Block
* Examples re-implemented using new block language
* Removed an incomplete example
* Reformulated Beard Tax Act example
* Improved Facts Interface in Scenario Editor
* New Payload and Response Format for Interview endpoint
* Revised uncertainty semantics for interview endpoint
* Updated (some) documentation (and marked the rest as out-of-date)

### Fixed
* Explanations in the test editor were being truncated

### Removed
* Data Type Blocks
* True and False Value Blocks
* Category and Attribute Display Blocks
* Category Attribute Block
* Known Category Blocks
* Category Equivalency Block

* updates documentation to reflect availability of "save as" in test editor.

## [v1.3.35-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.35-alpha) 2023-01-06

This release fixes a problem in the Covid Test example, and adds the Old Age Security Act example.

### Adds
* Old Age Security Act example

### Changes
* Covid Test example no longer has extraneous blocks, and uses the views feature of the scenario editor.

## [v1.3.34-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.34-alpha) 2023-01-06

This update allows you to configure, from a new tab in the scenario editor, the elements that should and should not be
displayed when using a particular test in the user interface for collecting facts. You can choose to hide
entire categories, specific objects, specific attributes for all objects in a category, or specific attributes
of specific objects in a category.

This allows the owner of a test to specify what fields should and should not appear in the scenario editor when
a test is viewed in that interface.

This update adds "time" to Blawx's date and duration capabilities. It includes new data types,
new data statements, a revised duration datatype, a new example, and extensive documentation.

There is a small chance that code generated using earlier versions will need to be updated, particularly
if it relies on some unusual behaviour of durations in previous versions.

### Added
* Datetime and Time Data Types
* Datetime and Time Data Value Blocks and Constructors
* Now and Today blocks
* Datetime Combination block
* Duration Comparison Block
* Documentation for all new Blocks

## [v1.3.30-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.30-alpha) 2022-09-28

This update gives the scenario editor the ability to indicate which objects, attributes, and values are relevant
for finding additional non-contingent answers to your test question. It also improves the relevance calculations
used in the interview endpoint.

BlawxBot is removed, and in the documentation and tutorials where it was referred to as an example it has been replaced with
the same example in the Scenario Editor.

### Added
* Scenario editor now indicates what additional facts would be relevant to un-conditional answers to the query by highlighting
  the relevant add object and add value buttons in green.
* Scenario editor will highlight relevant values in boolean and object selector new value inputs.
* Scenario editor will indicate (by highlighting the expand button) that there are hidden relevant attributes in collapsed categories and objects.

### Changed
* Constraints and other residual information will now be displayed inside models instead of inside
  answers in the scenario editor.
* Explanations for the same bindings but different constraints or hypothesized variables will be treated
  as explanations for the same answer in the scenario editor.
* The interview endpoint now returns all answers, including answers that rely on assumptions specified in
  the fact data.
* BlawxBot has been removed from the interface, until it is revised to work with the new interview endpoint.
* BlawxBot has been removed from the documentation, until it is revised to work with the new interview endpoint.
* Added documentation for the scenario editor.
* Updated the Beginner's Guide to use the scenario editor instead of BlawxBot in Step 4.
* Updated the tutorial to use the scenario editor instead of BlawxBot
* Updated images in the documentation to remove the BlawxBot button.

### Fixed
* The presence of singleton variables in answers no longer causes console warnings in the scenario editor.
* If you specify that a category is abducible in the scenario editor, it is abducible only with regard to objects
  that are not already a part of that category, this was not previously true, which was causing duplicate answers.
* If you specify that a category is abducible in the scenario editor, the attributes of abduced objects are also
  made abducible. This was not previously true, which was causing there to be no answers when only categories
  were abducible in the scenario editor.

## [v1.3.20-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.20-alpha) 2022-07-11

This release adds user registration, restricts access to projects that the user created,
and allows the user to create new projects from templates and tutorials.

These features make it possible for Blawx to be used in a multi-user environment.

### Breaking Changes
* Note that `.blawx` files from previous versions will not work with this version. You can address this problem
  by editing your `.blawx` files to add an `owner` field to your `ruledoc` objects, only. You can set the value
  to any number, it will be ignored on import.

### Added
* User registration - non-admin users can create user accounts for themselves.
* Users can now only see and interact with projects they created.

### Changed
* Tutorials and Examples are now available from the New Project button.
* Updates to Beginner's Guide and Examples documentation.

### Fixed
* A bug in the project import method has been fixed.

## [v1.3.18-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.18-alpha) 2022-06-29

### Added
* Rules can now have associated tutorials, which can be accessed in the right sidebar of the code editor when present

### Fixed
* A change in how the s(CASP) library reports reasons broke the interview endpoint's relevance calculations.
* Saving rules with no tests defined caused a malformed .blawx file
* Crash in New Rule screen
* Headers in doc sidebar were linked to root of blawx server

### Changed
* Dockerfile generates superuser and database at build time

* bootstrap is now installed locally to the Docker container to facilitate off-line use
* bootstrap-icons is now installed locally to the Docker container to facilitate off-line use
* What the exit and cancel buttons do (and whether they appear) in the rule editor now depends on whether you got
  to it from an existing rule, or while trying to create a new rule

## [v1.3.17-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.17-alpha) 2022-06-28

This version adds a first attempt at user authentication. Currently, one admin user `admin` and one non-admin user `demo`
are created by default, each with the password `blawx2022`. The admin account can use the admin interface at `/admin`
to add and remove users. All authenticated users can access all features of the site. Unauthenticated users cannot
access any of the server's capabilities. Exposing Web API end-points for public use will be implemented in a future version.

This version also re-implements the import/export features that were available prior to v1. If you are in the rule page,
you can now hit the "Export" button to download your rule, all of its associated code, and all of its associated tests,
as a single `.blawx` file. If you are on the main page, you can use the "Import" button to upload a `.blawx` file to your
server. Note that while Blawx is in alpha, there is no guarantee that `.blawx` files made with one version of Blawx
will work in a later version. We will do our best to indicate when there are breaking changes and how you might resolve
them.

We have also made a number of improvements to the user interface designed to make it easier to use and more consistent.

### Added
* The version of Blawx currently installed is now visible in the footer of each page after the copyright notice
* User Authentication - you will be prompted to log in when required
* Username, Change Password, and Logout/Login are displayed on header.
* Documentation - New Page on admin interface for adding users
* Import/Export - It is now possible to save your rule to a `.blawx` file from inside the rule screen,
  and to import a `.blawx` file from the main Blawx screen, allowing you to save and share your work
  even if the server goes down.

### Changed
* By default, only authenticated users have access to anything other than the rule index and the documentation
* Changes to the user interface on several pages

## [v1.3.16-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.16-alpha) 2022-06-23

### Added
* Beard Tax Act example project

### Fixed
* Code runs properly when single quotes occur in the text fields of a category or attribute customize block


## [v1.3.15-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.15-alpha) 2022-06-22

This release improves the interview endpoint's method of determining which attributes and categories
are relevant, and also improves BlawxBot's ability to describe fact scenarios and derive relevant
categories from relevant attributes. The Wills Act example has been modified to demonstrate
these capabilities, and the documentation updated.

### Changed
* The interview endpoint was modified to calculate question relevance better, and BlawxBot was
  revised to match.
* The Wills Act example and documentation was updated to demonstrate the new reasoning capabilities.

### Removed
* An example project was temporarily removed.

## [v1.3.14-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.14-alpha) 2022-06-22

Removing temporary fix for problems with SWI-Prolog. If you experience problems using
this version, you may need to rebuild the docker container using the `--no-cache` option,
to ensure that Docker grabs the latest release of SWI-Prolog when building.

### Changed
* The MQI.pl file and the steps in the Dockerfile for installing it have been removed,
  as the problems with MQI have now been resolved in the latest version of SWI-Prolog.

## [v1.3.13-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.13-alpha) 2022-06-21

This update brings all of the documentation included up to speed with the current version
of the software, taking into account outstanding bugs.  

### Added
* Documentation for Answers and Explanations

* Documentation for Defaults and Exceptions
* Documentation for Logical Constraints
* Documentation for Numerical Constraints
* Documentation for Numbers and Math
* Documentation for BlawxBot
* Documentation for Web API

### Fixed
* Legal texts with sandwich sections caused the code editor to crash. ([Issue #258](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/issues/258))

## [v1.3.11-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.11-alpha) 2022-06-08

Milestone: Automated Interviews

This release marks the end of the automated interview milestone. Expect near-future changes
to focus on updating documentation, adding demonstrations, and occasional bug fixes.

### Changed
* The interview end point now generates relevant category and attribute data on the basis of
  an abductive query based on the user's input so far.
* BlawxBot now uses the relevance information from the interview end point to determine whether
  or not it needs to ask each question.
* The Rock Paper Scissors demonstrate code has been modified to ensure that games and players
  are relevant categories in BlawxBot. This may be undone once
  BlawxBot is dealing better with category relevance and question order.

### Added
* A Wills Act demonstration, with a test that can be run in BlawxBot to demonstrate that it
  is deciding whether to ask questions on the basis of whether they are logically relevant.

## [v1.3.10-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.10-alpha) 2022-06-07

Fixing display of attributed variables in answers.

### Changed
* Inequality and numerical constraints on bound variables are now displayed in the bindings of answers.
* Names generated by the reasoner are not displayed as attributes.

## [v1.3.9-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.9-alpha) 2022-06-03

Added ontology and interview endpoints for tests, and added BlawxBot demonstration expert systems to tests.

Note that there are a lot of improvements to come in BlawxBot, but it will at least run all the existing example tests.

Also made the navigation tree and output pane display automatically, to simplify the interface for new users.

### Added
* Each test now has a `onto/` endpoint from which a list of categories, attributes, and their natural language
  generation expressions can be obtained.
* Each test now has a `interview/` endpoint which will currently return any answers that can be
  generated, ignoring the "known" entries in the data submitted over JSON, and a list of relevant
  categories and attributes to collect as input. Currently, all categories and attributes are returned
  in all cases.
* Demonstration chatbot at `bot/` for each test
* "Bot" button in test endpoint.

### Fixed
* The ontology endpoint now works with codebases that have no attributes in them.

### Changed
* The Copyright notice in the footer was corrected.
* The output pane in tests is displayed automatically when the user clicks "Run".
* The navigation pane in the code interface is displayed automatically when the page opens.


## [v1.3.8-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.8-alpha) 2022-05-12

Updates to the JSON data format expected by the tests/run endpoint.

### Added
* You can now make "assume" statements in your data payload to
  the test/run endpoint.

### Changed
* The format expected by the test/run endpoint now looks like this:
  ```
  {
    "person": {
      "members_known": false,
      "attributes_known": {
        "test_attribute": false
      },
      "members": {
        "jason": {
          "favourite_number": {
            "values_known": false,
            "values": [42]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  Detailed documentation will come later, but the 'members_known', 'attributes_known', and 'values_known',
  give you the ability to add three different sorts of
  "assume" statements over the JSON Payload.


## [v1.3.7-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.7-alpha) 2022-05-11

* Net 30 Example

## [v1.3.6-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.6-alpha) 2022-05-11

This release just finishes a first draft of the code for the Rule 34 example, and adds
a test that replicates the experiment originally done in [Morris, Jason. "Constraint answer set programming as a tool to improve legislative drafting: a rules as code experiment." *Proceedings of the Eighteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law*. 2021.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3462757.3466084)

### Changed
* Rule 34 example is finished

### Added
* Test for Rule 34 example

## [v1.3.5-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.5-alpha) 2022-05-09

This release adds some examples, but more importantly makes some changes to the reasoner to
ensure that a problem with some tests not returning results.
The Rule 34 example is incomplete, and will be updated in a later release.

Much thanks to Jan Wielemaker (SWI-Prolog) and Eric Zinda (MQI) for upstream code changes
that were necessary to get those tests running.

### Added
* Some examples rules, and tests.

### Changed
* Some tests will now return an additional variable named "Attributes".

### Fixed
* Problems with some queries that appeared not to terminate have been corrected.
* links to rules in a span of text now show up properly in explanations

## [v1.3.4-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.4-alpha) 2022-04-27

This update makes changes to the back-end of how code is generated by Blawx. The
only user-facing change should be the fix below.

### Fixed
* Code with comments in the Blocks will now work properly (issue #184)

## [v1.3.3-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.3-alpha) 2022-04-20

This update improves the formatting of explanations in the reasoner, adds text
of the relevant rules to the output of the reasoner, and makes corresponding
changes to the API endpoint for running tests.

This version will break code that was using the previous version of the blocks
in the "known sections" drawer of the toolbox.

### Added
* Answers include the bindings of the variables named in the Question.
* A new `{rulenumber}/rule/{section_id}` endpoint has been created that will return
  the XML and plain text of a portion of the rule's text document indicated by the `eId`
  attribute for the AkomaNtoso section.

### Changed
* If a question returns multiple explanations, they are now grouped according
  to the bindings for the variables in the question. This allows the user to
  see which explanations are for the same answer.
* Explanations are now presented in a nested collapsible tree structure, so
  that the user can navigate to the portions of the explanation that are
  most relevant for them.
* The format of results from the `{rulenumber}/{testname}/run` endpoint has
  been modified extensively.
* In explanations, when a rule is mentioned in an "according to",
  the name of the rule is a link with a tooltip that
  will show the text of the relevant section.
* We have changed how rule names are displayed in explanations to avoid
  exposing implementation details not relevant to the user.

## [v1.3.2-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.2-alpha) 2022-04-07

This update allows you to use the defeasibility features for defaults
and exceptions that occur inside a single section of the rules.

### Added
* Blawx now supports the use of span elements generated in Clean>=0.0.4
* In the Rule navigator, now only clicking on the "arrow" will open
  up the sub-parts of a section of a rule.

## [v1.3.1-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.1-alpha) 2022-03-29

### Fixed
* Problems with primary and known section drawers in Test interface.

## [v1.3.0-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.3.0-alpha) 2022-03-28

This update adds defeasibility back to the v1 series.

### Added
* There is now an "Exceptions" drawer in the toolbox, with the blocks required
  for using the defeasibility system: overrules, opposes, according to, and holds.
* There is now a "Known Sections" drawer, with rule section selectors for each
  of the elements in the rule navigation tree, for use in the according to and
  overrules blocks.
* A new example has been added called Tweety that shows how the exceptions
  system works.

### Changed
* The primary drawer is now dynamically generated, and has two additional
  entries, a query that includes the "holds" block, and a rule that includes
  the "according to" block filled in for the currently-selected rule.

## [v1.2.0-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.2.0-alpha) 2022-03-11

The point of this update is to make it easy to edit your natural-language
legislation inside the Blawx interface. The minor version change indicates
that fixtures in the previous versions will no longer load in this version of
blawx because the data structure has changed.

### Added
* Rule Editing View

### Changed
* Laws are now specified using the [clean markdown language](https://github.com/lexpedite/clean), instead of in Akoma Ntoso. Akoma Ntoso is still used to generate the user interface, and the ability to export and import Akoma Ntoso
  will be added later.

### Removed
* The demonstration Rule demonstrating a complicated Akoma Ntoso example has
  been removed.

## [v1.1.0-alpha](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx/releases/tag/v1.1.0-alpha) 2022-03-01

### Added
* Code is now organized among Rules, Sections, and Tests
* Rules can be created using Akoma Ntoso encodings of legislation
* Complex Akoma Ntoso example
* Simple Rock Paper Scissors example with encoding and test

### Changed
There have been significant changes to almost all aspects of the tool, many of
which are breaking. You can expect that code created with any previous version
will not work in this version.

* New reasoning engine (from Flora-2 to s(CASP))
* Server-side workspace management

### **Major Version Change**

The move from v0 to v1 indicates there is no compatibility between Blawx code written for v1, and for previous versions.

### Added
* Natural language explanations
* Multiple model responses to queries
* Numerical constraints
* Logical constraints
* Compiler warnings
* Live code generation
* Server side management of workspaces
