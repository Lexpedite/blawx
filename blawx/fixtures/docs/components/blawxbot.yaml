      # BlawxBot

      BlawxBot is a chatbot-style expert system that you can use in conjunction with any
      test you have defined on Blawx.

      ![Bot Button](/static/blawx/docs/images/bot_button.png)

      To start BlawxBot, click on the "Bot" button in the test editor screen.

      You will be taken to a user interface with a button bar across the top, a conversation
      window on the left, and a sidebar on the right.

      ## Buttons

      ![BlawxBot Buttons](/static/blawx/docs/images/blawxbot_buttons.png)

      The buttons available in the BlawxBot interface are:

      * Restart - restarts the expert system interview, forgetting all facts provided by the user
        in the conversation.
      * Help - opens the Blawx documentation in a different window
      * Exit - Closes BlawxBot and returns you to the test editor for the same test.

      ## Sidebar

      The sidebar on the right of the screen has three sections.

      ![BlawxBot Sidebar](/static/blawx/docs/images/blawxbot_sidebar.png)


      ### Answers

      This section will display the first answer or answers that BlawxBot can find, with
      all the explanations for those answers, in a format similar to the output of the test
      editor.

      Note that while pressing "Run" in the test environment takes all the facts provided and
      finds all valid answers and explanations for those facts, BlawxBot is always searching
      for valid answers on the basis of what it already knows. That means that if you enter
      the same facts in BlawxBot that were entered into a similar test, BlawxBot may not find
      all the answers that were found in the test, because it stops asking for inputs as soon
      as it finds at least one valid answer.

      ### Test Facts

      This section of the sidebar shows you the facts that BlawxBot already knows because they
      were defined in your test, or in the rule itself.

      ### User Facts

      This section of the sidebar shows you the facts that you have provided to BlawxBot so far
      in the interview.

      Facts in the Test Facts and User Facts are displayed in a tree structure three layers
      deep. The first layer is the names of categories defined in the code. The second layer
      is the name of objects that have been declared to belong to that category. The third layer
      is values that have been assigned to attributes of those objects, in the format
      `attribute: value`.

      ### Interview

      In the interview window, text generated by BlawxBot is displayed on a blue background,
      and text that you type into the chat is displayed on a grey background.

      # How BlawxBot Asks Questions

      BlawxBot is aware of the Blawx-specific ideas of Categories, objects, attributes, and
      values. It asks two kinds of questions:
      * Do you want to add data?
      * What data do you want to add?

      ## Asking If You Want To Add Objects, and Values

      BlawxBot will ask you whether you want to create additional objects, or to set
      values for the attributes of objects that have already been created. If it asks
      this sort of question, you must answer `yes` (note lower case) in order to add
      an object or value. All other answers will be treated as a "no".

      ## Asking for Objects and Values

      If you say that you want to add an object, BlawxBot will ask you what object you
      want to add. If you say that you want to add a value, it will ask you what value
      you want to add. Your answer must be the text representation of that value that
      would appear in the "Code" section of the output section of the test editor.

      For objects, whether creating one, or referring to one in an attribute, you must
      use only text with no spaces, and it must not start with a capital letter.

      For numbers, you can enter the number and decimals with no separators.

      For dates, you must use the format `date(YYYY,M,D)`. For example, "January 3, 2001"
      would be `date(2001,1,3)`. Note that you do not use leading zeros for the month and day.

      Similarly, durations must be in the format `duration(S,Y,M,D)`. Here, S is either
      `1` for "into the future" or `-1` for "into the past", and Y, M, and D represent the
      number of years, months and days respectively.

      # How Does BlawxBot Decide What To Ask?

      BlawxBot will ask you questions in the following order, if they are relevant, and if
      there are not any valid answers based on the facts it already has:

      1. BlawxBot goes through the relevant categories, one-by-one. The order of the categories
         is arbitrary.
      2. If there are objects in that category, it goes through each, one-by-one.
      3. For each, if there are relevant attributes, it goes through each, one-by-one.
      4. For each attribute, it asks you to add values to that attribute until you indicate
         there are no more values to add, then starts over at 1.
      5. If there are no objects in the category, or if all of the values have been collected
         for all the objects in the category, it asks if you would like to add another object,
         and starts over at 1.
      6. If there are no more relevant questions to ask, it says that it could not find an
         answer.
      
      # How Does BlawxBot Know What's Relevant?

      At the start of the interview, and every time you change the information (either
      by adding information, or indicating that there is no more
      information of a certain type), BlawxBot accesses the `/interview` endpoint for
      your test, and gets information from the reasoner about whether there is an answer,
      and what additional questions are relevant.

      If there is an answer, it stops the interview and displays the answer.

      For information on how the endpoint calculates the relevance of questions, see the
      documentation about the test APIs.

      # Tips Using BlawxBot

      ## Writing Tests for BlawxBot Expert Systems

      If you have a test that defines some facts and poses a question and gives the expected
      answer when run in the test editor, that same test will work in BlawxBot, but 
      BlawxBot will not ask any questions. That is because the facts in the test are
      known to BlawxBot too, and it is not necessary to ask any questions to find an answer.

      If you want BlawxBot to ask for inputs, you need to create a tests which returns
      "no models" when you click "Run", so that BlawxBot will need to ask the user for input
      before finding an answer. Many tests written for use in BlawxBot will include only a question,
      and no facts.

      ## How BlawxBot Deals with Existing Objects

      Note that if there are objects in the rules or the test, BlawxBot will ask the user
      about attributes for those objects before asking whether any objects should be added
      to the category.

      ## BlawxBot Will Sometimes ask the User to Answer the Question

      It's not being lazy, we promise.
      BlawxBot is not (yet) aware which of the attributes represents the question
      encoded in the test. So depending on the question order, it may ask the user to
      provide a value for that attribute themselves. If they do, that will immediately end
      the interview, because BlawxBot now has the answer to the test question.
      
      When using BlawxBot, if it asks whether you would like to add a value to the attribute
      that is being queried in the test, just answer "no".
