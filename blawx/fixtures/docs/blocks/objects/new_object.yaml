      ![New Object Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/new_object.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The new object block is found in the Objects drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The new object block is used to create a new object in a given category.

      ## Technical Details

      The Objects drawer of the Blawx toolbox will include one new object block
      for each defined category. The appearance of the new object 
      block by the category declaration block. As such, the
      new object block may not actually include the name of the category to which
      it applies.

      For instance, you might have a category "person", which has a new object
      block that reads "(object) is a human being".

      The new object block asserts that the named object is in the category.

      The text field must be the name of the object, which must not include spaces
      and must start with a lower-case letter. Names for objects must also be unique.

      The new object block is a statement, and can be stacked with other statements.

      When used in the conditions of a rule or a question, it checks to see whether the
      named object is a member of the category. But typically, you will want to use
      the object category block to test for category membership in rules and questions,
      because it allows you to use variables for the object, instead of needing to type
      the object's name.

      When used in a fact or in the conclusion of a rule, it asserts that the object is
      a member of the category. But in the conclusion of a rule, you are probably going
      to want to use the object category block so as to be able to draw that conclusion
      about more than one thing.

      Typically, therefore, the new object block is used only in facts.

      ## Tips

      You will usually only need to create a large number of objects when you are testing
      your rules, but there are some circumstances where there are a limited number of
      objects in a category and you can define them in advance. In that case, it can be helpful
      to combine the new object blocks in a single fact block, so that it can be collapsed to
      make your workspaces easier to read.

      Note that it is not possible to declare that an object exists without assigning it to
      at least one category. But it is possible to take an object that has been created in one
      category and add it to additional categories later. This can be done by using the
      new object block multiple times with different categories, but with the same object name. The safer
      method, however, is to create the object once, and then use the object category block
      to assign additional categories to it.
