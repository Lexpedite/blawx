      # New Category Block

      ![New Category Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/new_category.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The new category block is found in the Categories drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The new category block is used to create a new category of objects.

      ## Technical Details

      The new category block is a statement, and can be stacked with other statements.

      The new category block accepts the name of the category.

      It also accepts text that should appear before and after the name of the object in explanations.

      ## Tips

      Names of categories should be unique, but can safely
      overlap with the names of non-boolean attributes.

      To be valid, a category name must

      * contain only numbers, underscores, and letters
      * begin with a lowercase letter
      * not end in an underscore followed by only digits

      The block will automatically remove leading and trailing spaces, convert spaces to underscores,
      and convert an initial uppercase letter into lowercase. Other invalid values will be rejected, and
      the value of the field will not be changed.
