      # New Category Block

      ![New Category Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/new_category.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The new category block is found in the Categories drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The new category block is used to create a new category of objects.

      ## Technical Details

      The new category block is a statement, and can be stacked with other statements.

      The new category block accepts a single field, which is the name of the category.
      To be valid, the name of the category must begin with a lower-case letter and not
      include any spaces.

      ## Tips

      Multiple new category blocks with the same category
      name will have no effect.
