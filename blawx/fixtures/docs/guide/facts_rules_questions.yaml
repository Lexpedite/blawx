      # Facts, Rules and Questions

      The vast majority of the encoding
      that you do in Blawx will be done setting out Facts, Rules, and Questions. They
      are the starting points for the encoding process.

      When you encode laws,
      you will do it by setting out facts and rules. Then, when you want to use the
      laws you have encoded, you will use questions.

      ## Facts
      A “Fact” in
      Blawx represents a thing that is known with certainty. If you have a fact, you
      need to put it in a Fact block, which looks like this:

      ![fact]({{ site.baseurl
      }}/img/fact.png)

      So for example, let’s say we have some code that represents
      the idea that Socrates is a human being. That would be placed in a Fact block.

      ![socrates_human]({{
      site.baseurl }}/img/socrates_human.png)

      As you will see in the documentation
      around Categories, you may also make statements about Categories of objects,
      like saying “A dog is an animal.” These are also treated as facts because they
      are a thing that is known with certainty.

      A fact block can hold as many
      unrelated facts as you would like. And you can have as many different fact blocks
      in your workspace as is useful.

      ![socrates and dog]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/socrates_human_dog_animal.png)

      It
      can be helpful to create separate Fact blocks for pieces of information that
      you will be working with at the same time, so that when you are not using them
      you can Collapse the fact block and leave your workspace a little easier to
      read. See the documentation on the Blawx User Interface for details on collapsing
      and expanding blocks.

      If you ask Blawx whether or not something is true
      that you have stated as a Fact, the answer is always yes, without further explanation.
      Facts explain themselves. In fact, you can imagine a Blawx explanation as saying
      "because you told me so as a fact", after any line of an explanation that
      doesn't have further explanations.

      Typically facts are used at two different
      stages of the encoding process. First, they are used to set out the terms of
      the conversation (e.g. “Human is a Category”, “Mortal is a Category”). Then
      fact blocks take a back seat while rules are written using those terms (e.g.
      “We know a thing is a mortal if we know that thing is a human.”). Then we come
      back to using fact blocks to describe a specific fact scenario that we want
      to ask questions about (e.g. “Socrates is a Human”). Then we use queries to
      ask questions (e.g. “Is Socrates a Mortal?”).

      It can be helpful to separate
      facts that are always true in the ruleset from facts that are only true in the
      specific scenario being tested, and multiple fact blocks can be used for that
      purpose.

      Note that when you use your encoding over the Web API, this
      second type of fact, the case-specific kind, is provided by the user in the
      request that is sent to Blawx. Your deployed code should not have testing facts
      inside it, because the user's data will add to them, not replace them.

      ##
      Rules
      Rules are the most important part of encoding in Blawx. They are where
      you describe the simple logical building blocks that Blawx can combine in complicated
      ways to generate new insights. That is why the technology that Blawx implements
      is often referred to as “rules-based artificial intelligence”.

      A rule
      has two parts. The first part is one or more statements that can be proved true
      by the rule, called the “conclusions.” The second part is the “conditions” that
      must be met for the conclusion to be proved true.

      ![rule]({{ site.baseurl
      }}/img/rule.png)

      A rule block has one slot for the conclusions, one slot
      for the conditions.

      A rule with no conclusions should be a Question or
      a Constraint, and a rule with no conditions should be a Fact, so a rule block
      needs both statement connections filled to work properly.

      ### A Note
      on If/Then
      Some people might express rules as `if conditions then conclusions`.
      \ We prefer to avoid the words “if” and “then” to describe rules, because people
      who are familiar with imperative programming languages (which is most of the
      programming languages out there) will have in their minds a different meaning
      for “if” and “then.”

      In imperative programming, `if conditions then conclusions`
      means “if right now the conditions are true, then next the computer should do
      conclusions.”

      Blawx is a declarative logic programming tool, not an imperative
      one. Which means that the rule `if conditions then conclusions` means “if conditions
      are true, then conclusions are also true.”

      When using Blawx, remember
      that you are not describing what steps the computer should follow. You are describing
      what is known (the fact, or the conclusion for rules), and when it is known
      (always for facts, when the conditions are true for rules).

      ## Questions
      Once
      you have encoded rules and described relevant facts, you will want to ask a
      question. That is what the question block is for.

      There are two kinds
      of questions… yes/no questions, and search questions.

      ### Yes/No Questions
      A
      question that does not include variables is a “yes/no” question. An example
      is “Is Socrates Mortal?”

      ![is socrates mortal]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/is_socrates_mortal.png)

      This
      question will be answered by the Blawx reasoner with either the bare statement
      "socrates is mortal", or “No”.

      ### Search Question
      A question that
      includes variables is a “search” question. Blawx attempts to find any objects
      that it can place in all the variables used so that the all of the statements
      will be true. If it can’t find any, it will respond “No.” If it can find any
      examples, it will provide each combination of objects that made the statements
      true, and each reason for each combination of objects.

      So the question
      “is Socrates Mortal” above, which is a “yes or no” question, can be changed
      into a search by replacing “Socrates” with a variable. We will name the variable
      “Who”, because it reads better, but the name is unimportant, as long as you
      use the same variable name everywhere that it is important the rule is referring
      to the same object.

      ![who is morta]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/who_is_mortal.png)

      If
      you ask this question of the Reasoner, the answer back will be:

      ```
      socrates
      is a mortal, because
      socrates is a person
      ```

      Remember that a
      question requires all of its blocks connected by the And connectors to be true
      at the same time in order to find any answers. So make sure you are only asking
      one question at a time.

      ## Declarations in Facts and Rule Conclusions
      vs Rule Conditions and Queries
      Declaration blocks for objects and categories
      have the usual meaning when used in a fact or the conclusions of a Rule block.
      But they have a different meaning when they are included in the conditions of
      a Rule block, or in a query.

      A declaration causes the object, category,
      or attribute to exist when used inside a fact block or the conclusions of a
      rule. Inside a condition block, they test whether or not those declarations
      have been made somewhere else.

      So this rule says “we know fruit is a
      Category if plants are living things.” This rule has the effect of creating
      a category when its conditions are met.

      ![conclude fruit]({{ site.baseurl
      }}/img/conclude_fruit.png)

      However, in the next rule, the same Category
      declaration block “Fruit is a Category” does not create the category fruit,
      but instead asks whether the category has been created.

      ![query fruit]({{
      site.baseurl }}/img/query_fruit.png)

      If the category Fruit has not been
      defined anywhere (in a fact, or the conclusion of a Rule that had true conditions),
      then the answer to the query “is Fruit a category” will be no.

      This can
      be confusing, because Blawx still creates a “Known Category”, “Known Object”
      or “Known Attribute” block in the toolbox regardless of where the relevant block
      is used. So you may have a Category selector block called “Fruit” while *in
      the code* the category fruit does not exist.

      So it is important to remember
      the effect of declaration blocks in different locations:

      > **In Facts
      and Rule Conclusions, a new object or new category block or new attribute block
      means “this thing exists”. In Rules Conditions and Queries, a declaration block
      means “does this thing exist?”**
