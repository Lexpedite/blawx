      # Logical Constraints

      **Note: The logical constraints feature is not currently working properly. This
      documentation describes how it is anticipated to work, but using logical constraints is
      not currently recommended.**

      Whereas a fact allows you to say what is always true, and a rule allows you to say what
      is sometimes true, a logical constraint allows you to say what is never true.

      Imagine, as a small example, a situation where we are considering all possible combinations
      of a person and a house. The people are albert, bernice, and charles, and the houes are red, blue, and green.
      We might encode that ontology like this:

      ![House Ontology](/static/blawx/docs/images/house_ontology.png)

      Now we might want to consider all possible combinations. So we create a rule that any
      house and any person constitute a possible residence. The rule looks like this:

      ![Possible Residence Rule](/static/blawx/docs/images/possible_residence_rule.png)

      If we now query the possible residences, we will get 9 answers. albert might
      live in red, blue or green, bernice might live in red, blue or green, and charles might
      live in red, blue or green.

      Now imagine that there is a rule that albert cannot live in blue. We might implement that
      rule by creating a default, which is that every combination is possible, and then imposing
      an exception, which is that the combination of albert and blue is not possible. But that
      would require using the defaults and exceptions method, which means that it would require
      changing the rule and query above to use "according to" and "holds".

      What we can do, instead, is to make a logical constraint, and simply say the thing that cannot
      be true, like this:

      ![Albert Blue Constraint](/static/blawx/docs/images/albert_blue_constraint.png)
      
      If we run the code with that logical constraint added, the number of answers we receive is
      reduced to 8.
