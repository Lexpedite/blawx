# Install Blawx

The recommended method of installing and running Blawx is with Docker.

## Install Docker

Install Docker for the platform you are using.

## Clone Blawx

Using git, clone this repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx blawx
```

## Build and Run Blawx

Build the blawx image with the following commands
```
cd blawx
./update.sh
```

Note that the `./update.sh` script runs the blawx server in the terminal, for development purposes, so that you can see debug information.
If you want to run the docker container in the background, add `-d` as a flag to the `docker run` command in that script.

This command will take several minutes to run the first time.

The Blawx server will now be available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000),
and the administrative console will be available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin).

You can log into the admin console using the username "admin" and the password "blawx2022", which should be
changed immediately on logging in. 

If you would like to configure the name of the admin user, you can do that by changing the default value
in the Dockerfile, or by providing the flag `--build-arg SU_PASSWORD=password` to `docker build` instead
of running the `./update.sh` script.

A demo account with username "demo" and password "blawx2022" is also created,
and should be deleted in the admin interface if you want to restrict access to your server.

## Configure ChatGPT Integration

If you wish to run Blawx with ChatGPT integration, which allows for AI-generated summaries of explanations to be displayed
to the user in the scenario editor, you will need to not use the `./update.sh` command, and instead enter these two commands:

```
docker build -t blawx .
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 -e OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key_goes_here" blawx
```

## Updating Blawx

Blawx is under active development. Currently, updates are being sent to GitHub only, there is no published
python module or docker container. In order to run the most recent version of Blawx, go to the directory
in which you installed it, and run these commands:

```
git pull
./update.sh
```

Occasionally, there are changes made to Blawx that require a fresh install of other dependencies.
Whenever that is the case, it will be mentioned in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md). If a full
re-install is required, then you should instead perform these steps:

```
git pull
docker stop $(docker ps -qf "ancestor=blawx")
docker build --no-cache -t blawx .
./update.sh
```

## Deployment

Blawx is alpha software that should not be used for production purposes. However, if you want to deploy
it in a public or shared environment for learning or experimental purposes,
the provided docker configuration may not be appropriate. Instead,
it should be modified to follow the process for deploying a Django app. See [the Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/deployment/)
for more details.

Steps for deploying will include:
* changing the server_name settings in the settings.py file
* changing the DEBUG setting in the settings.py file
* adding configurations for secure CRSF and Cookies in the settings.py file
* configuring nginx or another proxy server to directly serve static files
* configuring TLS
* replacing the manage.py runserver with a production WSGI web server
* replacing the CORS configuration (which is open by default) with a whitelist
